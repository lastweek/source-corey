The native 64-bit toolchains on 64-bit OSs should build josmp.

* binutils

Download binutils 2.17 from http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/

./configure --target=x86_64-jos-linux --prefix=/usr/local \
        --disable-nls --enable-64-bit-bfd


* GCC 4.1.2

Unpack gcc-core-4.1.2 and gcc-g++-4.1.2.
rm -r gcc-4.1.2/libstdc++-v3

./configure --target=x86_64-jos-linux --prefix=/usr/local \
	--disable-nls --without-headers --with-newlib \
	--disable-threads --disable-shared --disable-libmudflap \
	--disable-libssp 

Note that for some versions of gcc, you may need to say "env
SHELL=/bin/sh gmake" if you have a different shell.

Also, note that some binaries won't compile (on OSX), but these you
shouldn't need.

* GDB

./configure --target=x86_64-jos-linux --prefix=/usr/local \
        --disable-nls --enable-64-bit-bfd

* To configure Bochs, you need --enable-x86-64:

./configure \
        --enable-4meg-pages \
        --enable-all-optimizations \
        --enable-disasm \
        --enable-debugger \
        --enable-global-pages \
        --enable-iodebug \
        --enable-ne2000 \
        --enable-pae \
        --enable-pci \
        --enable-pnic \
        --enable-smp \
        --enable-x86-64 \
        --enable-x86-debugger \
        --with-nogui

On bochs 2.2, --enable-instrumentation doesn't compile, but CVS
versions work.  Unfortunately, bochs doesn't seem to emulate AMD64
very faithfully.  For example, the OpenBSD 3.7 floppy won't boot.

With bochs 2.3.6 had to fix a number of small compilation problems (on
OSX), and dropped --with-nogui, but then it worked.  Make sure that if
you installed an old version of bochs, that you are using the romimage
that comes along with 2.3.6 and that your .bochsrc points to it (bochs
installs now in /usr/local/share/bochs by default instead of
/usr/local).  (If you use an old version, JOSMP wil bail out during
mp_init, and not found other CPUs.)

* Qemu

For qemu 0.9.1, you must apply ./conf/qemu-cmpxchg16b.patch to avoid
incorrectly interpreting cmpxchg16b as cmpxchg8b.

josmp has not been tested with earlier versions of qemu, some of which
have known bugs.

qemu-system-x86_64 (version 0.9.1) on 32-bit Mac, segfaults before the
kernel is loaded.

./configure --disable-kqemu --disable-sdl --disable-gfx-check \
	--cc=gcc34 --host-cc=gcc34 \
	--target-list='x86_64-softmmu'

* To boot josmp for the first time:

    % gmake
    % cp conf/sample-qemu.sh qemu.sh
    % ./qemu.sh

* To change the bootstrap application set KERN_DEFAULT in kern/Makerag
